BEFORE PLAYING

- If you have the plastic guitar peripheral, plug it into the computer
- Run "Xpadder [5.7].exe" in the "Xpadder" folder
- You are now ready to begin!
- Double-click "Riff Master.py" to begin playing.

HELP

- If it freezes, just close the program and try again.
- Framerate drops can happen because each falling note has its own pygame.Rect.
- The notes may not (and probably won't) match up with the music being played.
This is because the notes have been optimized for my laptop, and all other
computers will run it differently.
